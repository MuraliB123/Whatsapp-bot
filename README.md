### SETUP

![APP](imgs/app.png)

A demo app was created on the Meta Business platform.

![WEBHOOK](imgs/webhook.png)

The webhook was onboarded to the application to build a conversational workflow.

A test phone number was added in both the sender and recipient fields. To send messages to any phone number, a WhatsApp Business Account is required. Hence, for this demo, my phone number was added in the recipient field.

A FastAPI server was implemented to run locally and then tunneled using **ngrok** to expose it publicly. This allows the WhatsApp API manager to send webhook notifications to the server.

#### Workflow Flow:
